## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=54H0M0kvtiWrYvIAGqFa71v-7S5
Your Rationale: Wanted to go for colors that were bold but still calming. To give the comsumers the thought they can relax while using this console.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=35D0x0kvtiWkXxXwvcHSAnRvB6q
Your Rationale: I Chose this palette because it reminds me of a garden or the outdoors. The blue for the sky, red of the flowers and other plants, and green from the stems and leaves of those plants.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=43m0x0kvtiWkXxXwvcHSAnRvB6q
Your Rationale: Chose this palette because the blue makes for a readable, calm background while the other colors can be used for features that should stand apart from the background.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=15C0u0knZn9kPuPAAp3rxCAuEfS
Your Rationale: I choose red with a couple dark shades of red because that's the color ruby they choose to represent themselves and its the most thought of color when people think "ruby".
