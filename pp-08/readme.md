# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: looking at it makes me feel like its sturdy, trustworthy.

* Behavioral: Looks sleek, and doesnt draw attention. People who know a nice boot appreciate it but I dont get people going "oh my god look at his shoes"

* Reflective: It makes me feel worse when i dont wear my boots, like if I were to just wear gym shoes. My feet don't feel snug and protected.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Make the user feel Safe
2. Dont try and win the user over with over flashiness
3. Do what needs to be done, not abunch of extra stuff that could be confusing
